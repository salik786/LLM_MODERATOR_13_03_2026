# 🏜️ THREE DESERT SURVIVAL SCENARIOS (Still desert themed!)

    "task_name": "Desert Plane Crash Survival",
    "description": """
**BACKGROUND STORY:**

You and your two teammates were passengers on a small charter plane flying over the Arizona desert when the engine failed. The pilot managed to make an emergency landing, but the plane was damaged on impact. The pilot is unconscious and needs help.

It's 2 PM in mid-July. The temperature is 110°F (43°C). You're approximately 80 miles from the nearest town. The plane has a emergency beacon, but it's damaged and not working. You have no cell service.

**YOUR SITUATION:**
• You have moderate injuries - some cuts and bruises, but everyone can walk
• You have about 2-3 hours before sunset
• Nights in the desert can drop to 60°F (15°C)
• There's no water source visible in any direction

**THE ITEMS:**
From the crashed plane, you've managed to salvage the following 12 items:

SCENARIO_2 = {
    "task_id": "desert_survival_lost_hikers",
    "task_name": "Lost Hikers in the Desert",
    "description": """
**BACKGROUND STORY:**

You and your two friends are experienced hikers who decided to explore a remote canyon in the southwestern desert. You planned a day hike, but took a wrong turn and now you're lost. It's getting late, and you realize you won't make it back to your car before nightfall.

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
You started at 8 AM with plenty of water and snacks. By 2 PM, you realized you were off-trail. You've been trying to find your way back for 3 hours, and now it's 5 PM. You have about 2 hours of daylight left. Temperatures during the day reached 105°F, and nights will drop to 65°F.

**YOUR CURRENT SITUATION:**
• Everyone is tired but in good health
• You have minimal supplies from your day packs
• You told someone your general plans, but not exactly where you were going
• Search and rescue might be dispatched by tomorrow morning if you don't return

**ITEMS IN YOUR PACKS:**
You check your day packs and find the following items:
""",
    "items": [
        "A flashlight (with weak batteries)",
        "A topographic map of the region",
        "A compass",
        "An emergency space blanket (thin plastic sheet)",
        "A lighter (almost out of fuel)",

**BACKGROUND STORY:**

You and two friends are driving through the desert on a road trip when your SUV overheats and breaks down. There's no cell service, and you haven't seen another car for hours. It's midday, temperature is 108°F, and you're 50 miles from the nearest town.

**WHAT HAPPENED:**
The radiator cracked and all the coolant leaked out. The engine is too hot to touch. You have some basic supplies in the vehicle, but not enough water for a long hike. You have to decide whether to stay with the vehicle (easier for rescue to spot) or try to walk for help.

**YOUR CURRENT SITUATION:**
• Everyone is healthy but worried
• The vehicle provides some shade but will be extremely hot inside
• You have a few hours before sunset
• Nights will be cold (around 55°F)
• You left your travel itinerary with family, so search parties will be looking

**ITEMS IN YOUR VEHICLE:**
Searching your SUV, you find these items:
